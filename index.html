  <p>There are many benefits to holding some bitcoin. A few of current benefits are listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>With bitcoin you can make payments across borders, without a third party or expensive fees.</li>
<li>Owning bitcoin helps to protect you against loss of value in your country's currency.</li>
<li>All transactions are recorded, helping to protect against fraud.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bitcoin was proposed in 2008 and since then has been praised and written off over and over. The longer bitcoin retains its value the more confidence people, businesses and investors have in the cryptocurrency. In the UK bitcoin is still relatively unheard of and unused. The UK has some bitcoin friendly banks and businesses with more in development. The UK general adapt quickly to new technology and for bitcoin we would not expect the UK to lag too far behind.</p>

    <h3 class="post-title">Is Bitcoin back?</h3>
	<p>In the last month we have seen bitcoin's price rise over 30%, with many claiming this the beginning of the bull run. However, looking at the number of active users on the r/bitcoin subreddit there has been little change. This is even stranger when we see that subscribers are increasing at a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/91u91e/its_over_900000_rbitcoin_passes_900k_subscribers/">rapid rate</a>.</p>
    <p>The bitcoin price is still to reach the high of May so it is still early days to claim a recovery but the longer it remains above the recent lows the more confidence in the market should return.</p>
  </div>
  
<div class="is-bitcoin-back">
<p>Check out our updated graph of the bitcoin subreddit and the btc subreddit to see how they are online users are changing over time, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQWcfK67_Rgc99SH2gmhDmssJNopZpRFTnt-i4s7fP1MnCvXz_R6e0qWi0P8Xnc3fVutvEWuitpIEJL/pubhtml?gid=1715998224&amp;single=true&amp;widget=true&amp;headers=false">Bitcoin Subreddit Users</a>. </p>
	<p>It's always good to take anything posted on reddit with a pinch of salt, and to think about the motivation of the poster. The above is only one indicator to help you make your own decisions on where the price might be going but it hope it helps! </p>
