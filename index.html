<p>Bitcoin is still very much in it's early days but already we can see the potential to make the current monetary system more efficient. This will accelerate more and more as people begin to see the value of adopting a global rules based currency with a distrbuted ledger.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why bitcoin and not one of the mainly other cryptocurrencies?&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>It has been up and running since 2009, having been attacked several times, nobody has been able to break the system.</li>
<li>The coins are distributed more widely than other cyrptocurrencies.&nbsp;</li>
<li>There are 21 million bitcoin, no more will be created, so there will be no inflation, other crytocurrencies do not have a limited supply.</li>
<li>The rules cannot be changed without consensus, and if they do, you will then have coins on both the old and new versions if both continue to exist. Even if there is a minority want to maintain one of the forks it can still continue to function. This makes it very difficult for a mallicious party to take control of the currency.&nbsp;</li>
