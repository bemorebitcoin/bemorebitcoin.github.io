    <p>The bitcoin price can change rapidly, but it's best not to jump in because of a fear of missing out. Most of the time panic buying isn't a good idea and you won't miss your chance to buy cheaper bitcoin. Some people suggest it is best to buy small amounts of bitcoin over a longer period of time. This strategy for investment is known as dollar cost averaging. With this method you should avoid ending up buying bitcoin at the very peak. There is a risk you could miss out buying at the perfect low price, but much like selling at the peak this is very difficult to time!</p>
	<p>It is good to shop around, especially if you are planning to buy a significant amount of bitcoin. There can also be hidden fees and currency exchange rates to consider if you are not buying bitcoin from a UK company. </p> 
	<p>Some UK banks do also have restrictions on purchases of crypto currencies so you could find your account to be frozen or some additional checks made to allow you to make the trade. If you are purchasing from a company you have not heard of before or are unsure of their credibility it is a good idea to carry out some due diligence. </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Carry out a quick google, looking for reviews, or even news articles on the company or seller. Beware some companies can create fake reviews to give their brand credibility. </li>
		<li>Check the company has an office address and take a look on google street view to see if the company is based there or even if there is a building. </li>
		<li>Purchase a small amount first, checking that you receive your bitcoin.</li>
		<li>If the company has a telephone number or chat messenger see if you can talk to someone, even how they come across can be a clue as to what sort of company they could be representing.</li>
</ul>
	<p>Buying bitcoin in the UK isn't as difficult as it once was, with more options being made available all the time, and improvements to purchasing systems, exchanges and apps. There are many well established companies to buy bitcoin in the UK from so if you feel uncomfortable with the seller you will have many other options to explore.
